    """Simulate a single quantum script.

    This is an internal function that will be called by the successor to ``default.qubit``.

    Args:
        circuit (.QuantumScript): The single circuit to simulate
        rng (Union[None, int, array_like[int], SeedSequence, BitGenerator, Generator]): A
            seed-like parameter matching that of ``seed`` for ``numpy.random.default_rng``.
            If no value is provided, a default RNG will be used.

    Returns:
        tuple(TensorLike): The results of the simulation

    Note that this function can return measurements for non-commuting observables simultaneously.

    It does currently not support sampling or observables without diagonalizing gates.

    This function assumes that all operations provide matrices.
